This application does not gather any informaiton on the user other than system time and mouse location. It is not malicious in any way. **This is not designed to be used for scamming people**

According to Wikipedia: 

> **Scambaiting** is a form of Internet vigilantism, where the vigilante poses as a potential victim to the scammer in order to waste their time and resources, gather information that will be of use to authorities, and publicly expose the scammer.

Tech support scammers cold call those less tech-savy and use Event Viewer as a tool to convince the victim something is wrong with their computer by showing them perfectly normal error information the "Admin Events" Pane of Event Viewer. This application makes it infuriating to even get the mouse to hover that option.

### Features

-The mouse will become invisible and teleport

-The window will minimize semi-randomly

-The window will resize so small they have to resize it

-The scammer will be presented with a series of unintelligible captchas that involve matching and writing

-After failing many captchas, a modality window pops up telling them that Event Viewer is locked, and they must click on an icon to contiue. That icon links to indeed.com India with the phrase "literally anything" cued in the search box.
