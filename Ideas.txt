-MS clippy pops up (or something like that so I don't get sued)
	"I see you're trying to scam someone. Can I help?" (cue with keyboard probably)
-on keyboard button : spider crawls in from top corner of screen and promptly dissapears
-window minimizes first they click on a tree item
-cursor becomes invisible on some action
-window minimizes on cursor hover of some region of screen
-immediately minimize after restore sometimes
-cursor teleports to random spot
-simulate windows shutdown prompt "trying to shut down, but program won't let it"
-tree collapses after opened several times. After 2 or 3 times, wait 2 seconds before collapsing again; make them think it'll stay open
-resize to stupidly small window on restore
